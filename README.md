# Indoor Climate Data Exploration MOBISTYLE

## Dataset

The dataset can be found in the repository for MOBISTYLE project [here](https://github.com/SVGoogle/Data-Analysis-MOBISTYLE),
with data preprocessing and wrangling documentation available [here](https://data-analysis-mobistyle.readthedocs.io/).


## Summary of Findings
* Office temperature and window time open data has a strong correlation with outdoor air temperature
* Office temperature and RH have distributions with two peaks indicating seasonal data
* CO2 levels are stronlgy correlated with VOC levels, it means that both parameters are related to the indoor air polution from employees

## Key Insights for Presentation
* No clear evidence that the IAQ improved during the MOBISTYLE period
* Overall IAQ comfort categories time distribution is slightly better for BASELINE
* More time in Catgeory I and II both for Temperature and RH (COOLING)
* CO2 and VOC level comfort categories are more equally distributed (HEATING, COOLING)

## About MOBISTYLE
This EU H2020 project is focused on improving indoor air quality and user behavior by using modern and specially developed ICT solutions like the mobile game app or dashboard vizualisation app. Building energy savings, good indoor air quality and improving health related issues associated with staying inside buildings are the main concerns of this project.
